# Hi, I’m Gedi Harish 👋
*Ad astra per aspera.*

Cloud & Distributed Systems Engineer with a strong inclination toward **building real systems**, **prototyping ideas into working products**, and **learning by implementing from first principles**.

I work primarily across **AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, and observability**, backed by a foundation in **electronics engineering, embedded systems, and signal processing**. My approach to engineering is hands-on — build it, measure it, break it, and improve it.

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On

- Designing and operating **distributed systems on AWS**
- Container orchestration with **Kubernetes (EKS)**

## 🧪 What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub is a **build log and learning workspace**.

You’ll find:
- Cloud and infrastructure experiments
- Kubernetes and CI/CD prototypes
- Monitoring and reliability setups
- Data pipelines and automation scripts
- Systems and embedded projects from undergraduate work
- Proof-of-concepts, experiments, and design explorations

Not everything here is polished — most things are built to **understand systems deeply**.

## 🎓 Engineering Background

B.Tech in Electronics Engineering with extensive **hands-on product and prototype development during undergraduate studies**.

Worked on multiple system-level projects involving:
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Computer vision and signal processing
- Networking and system simulation
- Hardware–software integration

These experiences shaped my interest in **how complex systems behave end-to-end**, from sensors and firmware to distributed cloud platforms.

## 🌱 Current Learning Interests

- Distributed systems internals
- Cloud reliability and failure modes
- Kubernetes internals and scheduling
- Data engineering and real-time pipelines
- Edge computing and embedded + cloud integration
